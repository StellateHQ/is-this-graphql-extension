# Is This GraphQL?

Chrome extension based on [duo-labs/chrome-extension-boilerplate](https://github.com/duo-labs/chrome-extension-boilerplate) that detects whether a website is using GraphQL.

**Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/is-this-graphql/bpddjcoknlkjonemmdokaeeplmjhhnhh)**

## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Use `npx build` to build manually.
